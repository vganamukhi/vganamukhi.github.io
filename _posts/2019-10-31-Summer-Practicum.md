title: "Summer Practicum Poster: Lives Of Americans with Multiple Jobs"
date: 2019-10-31

 The lives of Americans with multiple jobs were compared with those with single jobs.  
 The data used was from the American Time Use Survey.  The timeframe was the years 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2017.  
 There are some important facts to note regarding these years. 
 The U.S. faced a recession during December of 2007, and GDP was low throughout all of 2008 and 2009.  
 2005 data gives a baseline for before the recession,  and 2009 data has the potential to give insight into what lives were like after the recession.  
 The data from 2013 and 2017 was used to keep an evenly spaced timeframe and follow the economic trends.
